**GDB Commands Cheat Sheet**

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to essential GDB commands for debugging programs efficiently.

---

### 1. Starting and Running GDB

```
gdb <executable>  # Start GDB with a compiled executable
run / r           # Run the program
run <args>        # Run the program with arguments
```

---

### 2. Setting and Managing Breakpoints

```
break <line>              # Set a breakpoint at a specific line
break <function>          # Set a breakpoint at a function
break <file>:<line>       # Set a breakpoint in a file at a specific line
info breakpoints / info b # List all breakpoints
delete <num>             # Remove a breakpoint by number
enable <num>             # Enable a breakpoint
disable <num>            # Disable a breakpoint
```

---

### 3. Running and Controlling Execution

```
continue / c   # Resume execution until the next breakpoint
next / n       # Execute the next line, stepping over function calls
step / s       # Execute the next line, stepping into functions
finish         # Continue until the current function returns
until <line>   # Continue execution until reaching a specific line
```

---

### 4. Inspecting Variables

```
print <variable> / p <variable>  # Print the value of a variable
display <variable>               # Automatically display a variableâ€™s value after every step
info locals                      # Show all local variables
set var <variable> = <value>     # Modify a variable's value
```

---

### 5. Memory Inspection

```
x/<format> <address>  # Examine memory at a specific address
info registers        # Show CPU register values
```

**Formats for `x/` command:**

- `x/4xw &var`  -> Examine 4 words in hex
- `x/s myStr`   -> Print string at `myStr`
- `x/10i $pc`   -> Show 10 assembly instructions

---

### 6. Call Stack (Backtrace)

```
backtrace / bt  # Show the call stack
frame <num>     # Switch to a specific stack frame
info frame      # Show details of the current frame
```

---

### 7. Debugging Threads

```
info threads    # Show all running threads
thread <num>    # Switch to a specific thread
```

---

### 8. Conditional Breakpoints

```
break <location> if <condition>  # Stop only if a condition is met
Example: break 15 if x > 10
```

---

### 9. Watchpoints (Tracking Variable Changes)

```
watch <variable>   # Stop when a variable changes
rwatch <variable>  # Stop when a variable is read
awatch <variable>  # Stop when a variable is read or written
```

---

### 10. Disassembly & Assembly Debugging

```
disassemble <function>  # Show assembly for a function
layout asm             # Show mixed source and assembly
stepi / si             # Step one assembly instruction
```

---

### 11. Saving and Loading Breakpoints

```
save breakpoints <file>  # Save breakpoints to a file
source <file>            # Load breakpoints from a file
```

---

### 12. Logging & Scripting

```
set logging on      # Log session output to a file
source <script.gdb> # Run a GDB script
```

---

### 13. Quitting GDB

```
quit / q  # Exit GDB
```
